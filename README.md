- There is a starter file with a setup created for you.
- You will make a to-do list for this exercise, where we can add, cross and delete to-dos.
- On the click on/off part, the input field should be showing and hiding. DONE
- In the starter file, there is an array of objects with to-dos already created. All you have to do
  is to iterate true them and show them below the input field.
- On click on every to-do, they will cross as a done and uncross as an undone.
  -And on click on the trash icon, the clicked to-do should be deleted.
- In the empty input field, you can write to-doâ€™s and on enter, they need to be shown at the bottom of the list. When the to-do is added to the list, the input field should be emptied.

DONT CREATE SEPERATE COMPONENTS FOR THIS EXERCISE, Everything you make, you should make in APP.js
